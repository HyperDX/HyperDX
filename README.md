# Hi! I'm hdx. Welcome to my GitHub profile!
My name is **Mateusz** but you can call me **hdx (Hyper DX)**. Nice to meet **you!**

I'm from Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± but as you can see I can speak English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ quite fluently :D.

## What am I doing here?
I don't have too much repositories here but currently I help with contributing [TEF6686_ESP32](https://github.com/PE5PVB/TEF6686_ESP32) in my free time.
It's a modification of DIY tuner with TEF6686 chip on board & ESP32 controller.

I've recently finished doing my weather station. You can check measurements [here](https://s7.fmdx.pl/weather/).

## Forms of contact
Hmm ok... So you've got more questions? Feel free to ask them on my [e-mail](mailto:crafter321yt@gmail.com).
