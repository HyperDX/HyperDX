# Hello! I'm hdx. Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm **Mateusz** but you can call me **hdx (Hyper DX)**.
I was born in Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± but as you can see I can speak English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ quite fluently :).

## What am I doing here?
I don't have too much repositories here but I'm curently working on [TEF-ESP](https://github.com/HyperDX/TEF_ESP) in my free time.
It's a modification of my own built tuner with TEF6686 chip on board.

## Contact forms
