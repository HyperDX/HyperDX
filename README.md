# Hi! I'm hdx. Welcome to my GitHub profile!
My name is **Mateusz** but you can call me **hdx (Hyper DX)**. Nice to meet **you!**

I was born in Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± but as you can see I can speak English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ quite fluently :D.

## What am I doing here?
I don't have too much repositories here but I'm curently working on [TEF-ESP](https://github.com/HyperDX/TEF_ESP) in my free time.
It's a modification of my own built tuner with TEF6686 chip on board.

I've recently finished doing my weather station. You can check measurements [here](https://s7.fmdx.pl/weather/).

## Contact forms
